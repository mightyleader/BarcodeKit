    Lot's of changes see extended description
    
    FIXED: subclasses of BaseBarcode could not use it's methods due to
    implicitly private inheritance. Set to public, resolved.
    FIXED: functions of BaseBarcode set to private now set to protected or
    public as required.
    TESTED: Codabar subtype successfully encodes and returns symbols. commit c067fd9f99b896bcce994b463223c8cf7987a57e Author: Robert <robstearn@me.com> Date: Fri May 4 17:48:03 2012 +0100

    Prototype code inserted into Base128 Class h and m files

    Major Update: Char sets and Special Characters working
    
    This is largely the completed and working constructor method for
    Base128 finished and tested. It now tracks and manages switches between
    character sets and inserts special switching symbols with appropriate
    metadata. Remaining is to add ASCII and Text data to the symbols.

    Tidy up: removed extraneous comments hand whitespace and tidied code
    
    Still needs a walk through review to eliminate unnecessary variables
    and loops and optimise for performance. Concern around run time speed
    right now, doesn't appear to be parser-based. commit f94851ef69a0f13c462ba4e7af6665c6c4721bb5 Author: Robert <robstearn@me.com> Date: Sun Apr 29 20:42:08 2012 +0100

    Slight XML format 'edit'
    
    A bit of a hack but the code wasn't picking up the last tag so I've
    added a final closing tag to each section that doesn't need picking up.
